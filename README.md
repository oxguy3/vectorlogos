# vectorlogos
A collection of SVG versions of various logos

I find it's often very hard to find nice vector versions of logos and emblems, so I've taken to vectorizing them myself and putting them in this directory.

## License
I make no copyright claim on my vectorizations; they're all CC0 Public Domain. However, since these are logos, you can probably assume they're all trademarked. A lot of them are very simple and probably don't meet the threshold of originality required for copyright, but IANAL so use them at your own risk.

I'm providing this as a public resource that I don't think is likely to be objected to, but if you are the rights holder for one of these logos and want it removed, email me at haydenschiff at gmail dot com.
